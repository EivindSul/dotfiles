# Electron discord.
# DONE, JUST DISABLED BORDERS - Disable border for gamescope.
# Cooler wallpaper setup, maybe find an ultrawide that I can shift a bit for every desktop to visually display the different desktops.
#   Ideally use a shell command to crop image. Maybe even do it automatically in hypr, so that I don't need to manually do it for every image?
# PDF-viewer is essential. Integrate it with vimtex.
#   Fix vimtex+zathura, make zathura not shitty when copying text etc.
# Image viewer that is not GIMP.
